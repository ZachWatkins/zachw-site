# Security

The only completely secure system is the one that doesn't exist in the first place. Having said that, I take the security of this application very seriously.

Therefore, please disclose potential security issues by email to zwatkins.it@gmail.com. I strive to provide an initial assessment of security reports within 48 hours and if warranted will begin work on a patch within 2 weeks of approval (also, feel free to contribute a fix for the issue).

## Notice

Even though I give no warranties or guarantees to the security of this repository (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)), I take security very seriously. I will do my best to respond to security issues as quickly as possible.
